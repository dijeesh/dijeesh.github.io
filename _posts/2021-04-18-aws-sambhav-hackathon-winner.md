### Amazon Smbhav Hackathon - Build for India - Winners

As part of the Amazon Smbhav Summit, Skillenza organized an all-India Hackathon Challenge and our team won the first prize.   Congratulation to Shamshir Anees, Vinila Cherichal, Haridasan Shanmugam, and Prabheesh Kuttan. And kudos to all other participants.

Everything happened over a casual chat with one of our team members Shamshir Anees, who is very keen to learn new technologies and used to build sample projects whenever he gets free time.  I was sharing the Hackathon Event details via our AWSUGKOCHI channels and asked him to take a look. He was very interested to learn Serverless Technology and ready to give it a try.

A crowdfunding platform for rural/urban farmers was one of the ideas in my mind for a long time. Since it is aligning with the theme of the Hackathon, I shared the details with him and he then created a 4 member team and registered for the event. From there in one week's time, they built the application and all the presentation materials.  

<br>
<br>

We really shocked when we came to know that we are in the final.  rounds. Shamshir did all the presentations with the help of team members. And finally on the 18th during the Summit, we were announced as the winners of the hackathon challenge.

<br>

Once again congratulation to Shamshir, Hari, Vinila and Prabheesh for your hard work and dedication.
